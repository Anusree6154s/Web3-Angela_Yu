The provided code defines an actor named `Token` in the Motoko programming language. This actor represents a token smart contract, and it includes various methods and state variables for managing and interacting with tokens. Here's an explanation of the code:

```
    import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
    import HashMap "mo:base/HashMap";
    import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
    import Iter "mo:base/Iter";
 ```

- These lines import necessary modules from the Motoko standard library, such as `Principal`, `HashMap`, `Debug`, and `Iter`.

    ```motoko
    actor Token {
    ```

- The code begins by defining an actor named `Token`. In the context of Motoko and the Internet Computer, an actor is a core construct used to model smart contracts or services.

    ```motoko
        let owner : Principal = Principal.fromText("baqnf-doc3c-6ph5k-hdmt5-7736l-e3suw-sy22l-t4yo3-okbpg-37sus-dqe");
        let totalSupply : Nat = 1000000000000;
        let symbol : Text = "DANG";
    ```

- Inside the `Token` actor, several initial values are set. `owner` is a `Principal` representing the owner of the token contract, `totalSupply` is a `Nat` representing the total supply of tokens, and `symbol` is a `Text` representing the symbol of the token.

    ```motoko
        stable var balanceEntries : [(Principal, Nat)] = [];
    ```

- A `stable` state variable named `balanceEntries` is defined as an empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains a `Principal` and a `Nat`. This variable is used to keep track of token balances.

    ```motoko
        private var balances = HashMap.HashMap<Principal, Nat>(1, Principal.equal, Principal.hash);
        if (balances.size() < 1) {
            balances.put(owner, totalSupply);
        };
    ```

- A private `HashMap` named `balances` is declared, which associates `Principal` (account) with their token balances (`Nat`). If the `balances` HashMap is initially empty, it is populated with the `owner` account and the `totalSupply`.

    ```motoko
        public query func balanceOf(who : Principal) : async Nat {
    ```

- A public query function named `balanceOf` is defined. It takes a `Principal` named `who` as a parameter and asynchronously returns the balance of tokens associated with that account.

    ```motoko
        public query func getSymbol() : async Text {
    ```

- Another public query function named `getSymbol` is defined. It returns the symbol of the token.

    ```motoko
        public shared (msg) func payOut() : async Text {
    ```

- A public shared function named `payOut` is defined, which takes a `msg` argument. It allows a caller to claim tokens. If the caller has not claimed tokens previously, it transfers a fixed amount of tokens to them. If the caller has already claimed tokens, it returns "Already Claimed!"

```motoko
    public shared (msg) func transfer(to : Principal, amount : Nat) : async Text {
```

- Another public shared function named `transfer` is defined. It allows transferring tokens from the caller to another `Principal` named `to`, specifying the `amount`. It checks if the caller has sufficient funds and updates the balances accordingly.

    ```motoko
        system func preupgrade() {
    ```

- A system function named `preupgrade` is defined. This function is called before upgrading the token contract and is responsible for capturing the current state of the contract's `balances` in the `balanceEntries` state variable.

    ```motoko
        system func postupgrade() {
    ```

- A system function named `postupgrade` is defined. This function is called after upgrading the token contract and is responsible for restoring the `balances` state from the `balanceEntries` captured during the pre-upgrade phase. If the `balances` are empty, it repopulates them with the initial supply.

In summary, this Motoko code defines a token smart contract actor with functions for checking balances, transferring tokens, and a special `payOut` function for rewarding users. It also includes pre- and post-upgrade functions for managing contract state across upgrades. The contract is identified by its owner, symbol, and total supply of tokens.
