Certainly, let's break down each code block and understand how they differ from each other in terms of functionality:

### Code Block 1:

```motoko
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
import Time "mo:base/Time";
import Float "mo:base/Float";

actor DBank {
  stable var currentValue : Float = 300;
  currentValue := 300;
  Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));

  stable var startTime = Time.now();
  Debug.print(debug_show(startTime));

  public func compound() {
    let currentTime = Time.now();
    let timeElapsedNS = currentTime - startTime;
    let timeElapsed = timeElapsedNS / 1000000000;
    currentValue := currentValue * (1.001 ** Float.fromInt(timeElapsed));
    startTime := currentTime;
  };

  public func topUp(amount: Float) {
    currentValue += amount;
    Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));
  };

  public func withdrawal(amount: Float) {
    let tempValue: Float = currentValue - amount;
    if (tempValue >= 0) {
      currentValue -= amount;
      Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));
    } else {
      Debug.print("Amount too large. Current Value less than zero");
    };
  };

  public query func checkBalance(): async Float {
    return currentValue;
  };
};
```

**Functionality (Code Block 1):**
- This code defines an actor `DBank` with the following features:
  - It initializes the `currentValue` variable with 300 (presumably a balance).
  - It initializes `startTime` with the current time.
  - It provides several functions: `compound`, `topUp`, `withdrawal`, and `checkBalance`.
  - `compound`: Calculates compound interest over time based on elapsed time since `startTime`. Updates the `currentValue`.
  - `topUp`: Allows adding a specified amount to `currentValue`.
  - `withdrawal`: Allows withdrawing a specified amount from `currentValue`. Checks if withdrawal is within the available balance.
  - `checkBalance`: Asynchronously returns the `currentValue`.

### Additional Code Blocks:

The additional code blocks are variations of the `DBank` actor with different features or behavior. Here's a summary of their differences:

- **Code Block 2 (Initialization):** Demonstrates the actor's initialization, defining `currentValue` and `id` as constants.
- **Code Block 3 (TopUp Function):** Adds a private `topUp` function to increment `currentValue`. The function can only be accessed within the actor.
- **Code Block 4 (Public TopUp):** Similar to Code Block 3 but makes the `topUp` function public for external access.
- **Code Block 5 (Public Withdrawal):** Introduces the ability to withdraw a specified amount while handling overdraft cases.
- **Code Block 6 (Balance Query):** Defines a query function `checkBalance` for quickly retrieving the balance.
- **Code Block 7 (Stable Variables):** Uses stable variables to store `currentValue`, enabling it to retain its value even after refreshing. Includes the `compound` function.
- **Code Block 8 (Compound Interest):** Focuses on the `compound` function, calculating compound interest and updating `currentValue`.

Each code block adds or modifies certain features or behavior of the `DBank` actor, making it suitable for different use cases. For example, Code Block 5 handles overdraft cases, while Code Block 8 calculates compound interest. Depending on the specific requirements of a banking system, you can choose the relevant code block to build the desired functionality.
