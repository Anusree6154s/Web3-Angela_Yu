Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. It is often used for creating documentation, writing README files on platforms like GitHub, and more. Markdown files are easy to read and write in plain text, and they can be converted to various output formats like HTML. Markdown formatting is based on simple conventions and symbols. Here are some common Markdown formatting rules and options:

1. Headers:
   To create headers, use the '#' symbol followed by a space. The number of '#' symbols determines the header level (1-6).

   Example:
   
   # Header 1
   ## Header 2
   ### Header 3
   

2. Emphasis:
   - Italics: Use `*` or `_` around the text you want to italicize.
   - Bold: Use `**` or `__` around the text you want to make bold.
   - Combined: You can combine them for bold and italic text.

   Example:

   *italic* or _italic_

   **bold** or __bold__
   
   ***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___
   

3. Lists:
   - Ordered lists: Use numbers followed by a period.
   - Unordered lists: Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.

   Example:
   
   1. Item 1
   2. Item 2

   * Unordered item 1
   * Unordered item 2
   

4. Links:
   To create hyperlinks, use square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL.

   Example:
   
   [Google](https://www.google.com)
   

5. Images:
   To insert images, use an exclamation mark before a link in square brackets.

   Example:
   
   ![Alt Text](image_url)
   

6. Code:
   - Inline code: Wrap code in backticks (`).
   - Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) or indent the text with four spaces.

   Example:
   
   `inline code`
   
   Code block
   ```


7. Blockquotes:
   Use the greater-than symbol `>` to create blockquotes.

   Example:
   
   > This is a blockquote.
   

8. Horizontal Rules:
   Use three hyphens `---`, three asterisks `***`, or three underscores `___` on a line by themselves to create a horizontal rule.

   Example:

   ---
   

9. Tables:
   You can create tables using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to define the header row.

   Example:
   
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
   

10. Escape Characters:
    To display special Markdown characters as literals, escape them with a backslash `\`.

   Example:
   
   \* This will not be italicized \*
   

These are the basic Markdown formatting rules and options. Markdown also supports various extensions and custom features depending on the platform or Markdown processor you are using.
